<h2><i class="icon-gamepad icon-large"></i>Gameplay</h2>
<p>No Man's Sky is a first-person, open world survival game. Players take the role of a planetary explorer in an uncharted universe. They are equipped with a survival spacesuit with a jetpack; a "multitool" that can be used to scan, mine and collect resources as well as to attack or defend oneself from creatures and other entities while on a planet; and a spacecraft that allows them to land and take-off from planets and travel between them and engage in combat with other space-faring vessels. With this equipment, the player is then free to engage in any of the four principal activities offered by the game: exploration, survival, combat, and trading.</p>

<h2><i class="icon-gamepad icon-large"></i>Survival is Key</h2>
<p>Every solar system, planet, ocean and cave is filled with danger, and you are vulnerable. Your ship and suit are fragile, and every encounter can test your skills to the limit. From dogfighting in space to firstperson combat on a planet’s surface, you will face foes ready to overwhelm you. And one mistake could see you lose everything. In No Man’s Sky, every victory and every defeat has lasting consequences.

<h2><i class="icon-gamepad icon-large"></i>Play how you want to play</h2>
<p>Whether you want to explore and see things never before discovered, or directly set course for the centre of the galaxy, how you play No Man’s Sky is up to you. But you cannot take your voyage lightly. You’ll need to prepare. Collect precious resources on the surfaces of planets and trade them for the ships, suits and equipment that will take you to your destiny in the stars.</p>
