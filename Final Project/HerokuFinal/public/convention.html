<p>Since it was first announced in December 2013, fans have been waiting for news and footage of the this ambitious project called No Man's Sky. Finally at this summers E3 convention, these fans were finally indulged.</p>
<p>This year at E3 we got to see a live demo that jumped right into the game and immediately demonstrated the insane scale of the universe. While the demo was brief, it filled in a few details about how the game will work — including the way you'll be able to explore the universe's endless star systems and warp between them.</p>

<p>Hello Games cofounder Sean Murray began the demo in a hangar, then launched into an ongoing space battle. Murray claimed the game is a "universe-sized sandbox", and that these kinds of battles are taking place across that entire universe. Players will be able to take sides in those battles, which are being fought by warring factions. Or they can pick a star on the expansive universe map, and travel there to discover planets and lifeforms.</p>

<p>Most impressively, this entire universe has been created by a tiny team of independent developers. Ten-person indie outfit Hello Games would need a thousand lifetimes to create by hand the millions of assets required for No Man's Sky — instead it built the game to procedurally generate stars, planets, and lifeforms, using base prototypes to create weird worlds of long-necked thunder lizards, lime-green grasslands, and continents covered in lush, orange forests.</p>
